# Code for Low-Rank Bandits via Tight Two-to-Infinity Singular Subspace Recovery

  This code contains an implementation of the algorithms used for the Policy Evaluation and Best Policy Identification tasks considered in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15739">the paper</a>  (SIPS,RS-PE,SBPI and RS-BPI). 
  The code is written in Python (version 3.11).





<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The numerical experiments considered in the paper can be rerun by uncommenting the corresponding sections at the end of the file. The size and rank of the reward matrix, the number of samples and the context distribution can be directly modified at the beginning of the file to run different experiments.
